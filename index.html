    <p>I am currently at the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov">Federal Reserve</a> supporting senior leadership in supervising the largest, most systemically important financial institutions that operate within the United States.  Prior to this, I was a member of the Large Bank Analytics and Supervisory Research and Analysis Units of the <a href="https://www.bostonfed.org">Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB)</a> where I regularly briefed <a href="https://www.bostonfed.org/people/bank/eric-rosengren.aspx">President Eric Rosengren</a> and other senior members of the FRBB on key trends and developments within the banking industry.</p>

<p>Prior to joining the FRBB, I was a Senior Global Financials Analyst at Calvert Investments, one of the oldest socially responsible investors within the United States, managing the Financials sleeve of the four active equity portfolios (AUM: $2.5 billion) and helping develop an ESG investment framework for financial services companies. I also previously held roles at UBS supporting industry leading senior analysts in covering 39 financial services companies with a combined market capitalization of over $1.7 trillion and Ernst & Young in New York City managing a team of consultants in implementing ERM systems for clients and assisting clients within the Financials space on international and state & local tax planning and compliance issues.</p>
 
<p> I recieved an A.L.M. in Extension Studies, Information Management Systems from <a href="https://www.harvard.edu"> Harvard University</a> with a focus on cybersecurity. Additionally I recieved a B.S. in accounting and a JD (admitted to the NJ and NY Bars) from the <a href="https://www.business.rutgers.edu"> Rutgers School of Business</a> and <a href="https://law.rutgers.edu"> Rutgers Law School</a>, respectively.
